# Mask-Recognition
Mask Recognition for Covid-19 using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)

Use crawler.ipynb to crawl images. 

Use convents-for-mask.ipynb to train the CNN with VGG.

Use Inception_and_ResNet.ipynb to train the CNN with Inception and ResNet.

Some attempts in Practical_Methods_for_DeepLearning.ipynb.
